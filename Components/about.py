‚úÖ Type: Symmetric-key block cipher
‚úÖ Key Sizes: 128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit
‚úÖ Use Case: Secure data encryption (e.g., banking, WiFi security, file encryption)

How AES Works:
AES encrypts data in blocks of 128 bits using a single key (symmetric encryption).

Key Expansion: The key is expanded into multiple round keys.
Substitution (S-Box): Each byte is replaced using a fixed lookup table.
Shift Rows: Rows of the data block are shifted to mix up the bytes.
Mix Columns: Mathematical transformation is applied to mix byte columns.
Add Round Key: XOR operation with the round key.
Repeat for 10, 12, or 14 rounds depending on key size.
üîí Why AES?

Faster than RSA
More secure than DES
Used in modern encryption (HTTPS, VPNs, disk encryption)""")
        st.write("""2Ô∏è‚É£ DES (Data Encryption Standard)
‚úÖ Type: Symmetric-key block cipher
‚úÖ Key Size: 56-bit
‚úÖ Use Case: Older encryption standard (replaced by AES due to security flaws)

How DES Works:
Splits plaintext into 64-bit blocks.
Uses a 56-bit key for encryption.
Performs 16 rounds of substitution and permutation using Feistel structure.
Uses XOR operations, S-box substitutions, and bit shifting to encrypt data.
‚ùå Why DES is Insecure?

56-bit key is too small (can be cracked in hours).
Vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
3DES (Triple DES) was introduced as a more secure version but is still slower than AES.""")
        st.write('''3Ô∏è‚É£ RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
‚úÖ Type: Asymmetric-key encryption
‚úÖ Key Size: 1024-bit, 2048-bit, 4096-bit
‚úÖ Use Case: Secure key exchange (e.g., SSL/TLS, digital signatures)

How RSA Works:
RSA uses two keys:

Public Key (for encryption)
Private Key (for decryption)
Steps:
Generate two large prime numbers (p, q) and compute n = p √ó q.
Compute Euler‚Äôs totient function: œï(n) = (p-1) √ó (q-1).
Choose an encryption key e, such that 1 < e < œï(n) and gcd(e, œï(n)) = 1.
Compute the decryption key d, where (e √ó d) mod œï(n) = 1.
Encryption: Ciphertext = (Plaintext^e) mod n
Decryption: Plaintext = (Ciphertext^d) mod n
üîë Why RSA?

Provides secure communication (e.g., used in HTTPS and digital signatures).
Slower than AES because of large key size.
Often combined with AES for hybrid encryption (e.g., RSA encrypts the AES key).
